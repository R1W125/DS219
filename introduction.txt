Hey, My name is Riwaz, I am a freshman studying Data Science at Boston University. My favorite class at BU has been WR151, Burning Questions. It is an easy class that fulfils many of the hub requirements that I need. The course has me focus on a research topic and write a research paper on it throughout a full semester.
